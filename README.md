# 🚦 Turkey Traffic Animations (Unity)

This repository contains a collection of **3D traffic scenario animations created in Unity**, designed for use in **driver education, traffic awareness, and instructional content** based on **real-world Turkish road layouts and rules**.

> Developed for **Traffic Sayfası** – a road safety and driver education platform based in Turkey.

Each animation visualises a specific traffic situation such as:
- Junctions & roundabouts  
- Lane merging  
- Pedestrian crossings  
- Traffic light behaviour  
- Vehicle priority scenarios  

The goal of this project is to produce **clear, consistent, and realistic visual explanations** of traffic behaviour using a reusable Unity animation pipeline.
